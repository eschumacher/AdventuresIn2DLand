Adventures In 2D Land
======================

Created by Erik Schumacher for a high school project.

This is very old, and only uploaded due to nostalgia.  Please do not judge me too hard for it!  I could not even drive yet :)

Language: Java

Adventures In 2D Land is a platformer written from scratch.  The game engine, physics, soundtrack, sound effects, and graphics (or lack thereof) were all written by Erik Schumacher.
